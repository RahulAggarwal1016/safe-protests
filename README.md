# Safe_Protests

From the womens' suffrage movement to Martin Luther King Jr, citizens has always relied on protests and public demonstrations to make change happen. With recent events in mind, it is becoming apparent that protesters need a way to protect themselves and stay informed during the middle of a protest or strike. Safe Protests is an app for organizing and staying safe during protests, providing live updates from protest organizers, information about protester rights, marking dangerous locations on a live-updated map, and the ability to notify contacts with a participant's last location if something goes wrong.


We are addressing the "Community" category. SDGs: 16 and 17
