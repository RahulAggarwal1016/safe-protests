# Safe_Protests

From the womens' suffrage movement to Martin Luther King Jr.'s rallies, citizens has always relied on protests and public demonstrations to make change happen. With recent events in mind, it is becoming apparent that protesters need a way to protect themselves and stay informed during the middle of a protest or strike. Safe Protests is an app for organizing and staying safe during protests, providing live updates from protest organizers, information about protester rights, marking dangerous locations on a live-updated map, and the ability to notify contacts with a participant's last location if something goes wrong.


We are addressing the "Community" category. SDGs: 16 and 17


## What inspired you to make this product?
We were inspired by the recent BLM protests around the world after the death of George Floyd at the hand of a police officer. We wanted to create a web app that was able to help citizens safely practice their right to free speech and protest. 

## What does your product do?
Our product is a web app that helps citizens safely organize and participate in protests. Users can submit information about a new protest to alert the rest of the users or view detials on a protest happening near them. The web app also provides resources to aid a user during a protest. They can mark locations with heavy police presence or the use of force to alert other users. The app provides a page with information pretaining to legal rights during protest for three different countries. Finally, the app also provides a list of common tips so that the user can protest safely. 

## How did you build your product?
We built our product using react, node.js, express.js and mongo.

## What challenges did you run into?
We initially wanted to create a mobile app using AndroidStudio, Kotlin and Google Flutter. However, some of our group members had trouble setting up Google Flutter on MacOS. Therefore, we decided to instead create a web app using React. 

## Are there any accomplishments you are proud of?
Creating a server to store protest data and using Twilio to send text messages. 

## What did you learn through this process?
We learned how to effectively setup Mongo for a database. 

## What's next for your product?
Next steps for Safe Protests: 
* Deploy our web app to Android and iOS. 
* Expand the number of features available in the app. 
* Make it available in more regions around the world.
